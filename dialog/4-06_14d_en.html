        God of Water comes from the blessing of Water God, which is extremely rare. But actually, God of Water can also be crafted. There is a kind of stone called Elements of Stone, which is the key for crafting God of Water. However, it's also tough to find the Elements of Stone. Maybe you can find them on Orc and Orc Fighters nearby the Orc Town. It's not easy for you to get it since the Orcs are so powerful.
