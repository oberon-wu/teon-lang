Adventurer, I can refine elemental source crystal for you.<br />
<br />
I can also Element Enchant your weapons by using elemental source crystal.<br />
<br />
When the Apocalyptic Magic of weapons is insufficient, you can purchase Pure Apocalyptic Source Crystal from me to add more power to your weapons.
