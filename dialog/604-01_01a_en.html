Our Chamber of Commerce is delegating powerful adventurers with <font fg=FFA500>level 59 or below</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Equipment Magic Crystal</font> for us in exchange for experience and Advanced Heroic Potion.<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect the Equipment Magic Crystal, I need you to submit <font fg=FFA500>Gem Collect Permit x1</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Gem Collect Permit Vendor</font> and purchase the Permit.<br />
