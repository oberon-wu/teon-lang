Also, I need you to find a man called <font fg=FFA500>Cyril</font>. Buy a piece of <font fg=FFA500>Intelligence from Shandow Knight</font> from him.<br />
<br />
He is actually a pedlar who sell intelligence. Nobody knows where he is since he always appear and disappear mysteriously. I can only know that <font fg=FFFF00>Every Sunday</font> he will appear at <font fg=FFA500>Dartford Region</font>.<br />
<br />
When you meet him, you need to directly call his name and speak out the code:<font fg=FFFF00>Only in the dark can you see the dark</font>.<br />
<br />
After buying the <font fg=FFA500>Intelligence from Shandow Knight</font> from him, take it and <font fg=FFA500>10</font> pieces of <font fg=FFA500>Spy's Report</font> to me.<br />
