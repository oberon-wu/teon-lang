<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, here is an <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Fog Magic Spell Book</font>. If you can spell this magic, then the <font fg=FFA500>Elven Garden</font> will be hidden in the fog. Even if the Orcs want to slip into the Elven Garden, they can only wander in the fog with no direction.<br />
<br />
I'm not capable enough to spell such an ancient magic. Could you please give this <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Fog Magic Spell Book</font> to <font fg=FFA500>Heian</font> for me? He is very famous among us, and I believe that with his ability, he will surelly succeed!<br />
