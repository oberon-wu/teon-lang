<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, here is an ancient spellbook named <font fg=FFA500>Fog Barrier</font>. If you can cast this magic, then the <font fg=FFA500>Elf Garden</font> will be hidden in the fog. Even if Orcs want to slip into the Elf Garden, they can only wander in the fog with no direction.<br />
<br />
I'm not capable enough to cast such an ancient magic. Could you please give this ancient spellbook to <font fg=FFA500>Heian</font>? He is the best mage among us, who is worthy to be trust!<br />
