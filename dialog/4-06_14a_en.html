<font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font> comes from the blessing of Water God, which is extremly rare. But actually, <font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font> can also be crafted. There is a kind of stone called <font fg=FFA500>Elements of Stone</font>, which is the key for crafting <font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font>.<br />
<br />
However, it's also very difficult to find the <font fg=FFA500>Elements of Stone</font>. Maybe you can find them on <font fg=FFA500>Orc</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Orc Fighters</font> nearby the <font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font>. It's not easy for you to get it since the Orcs are so powerful.<br />

<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, as long as you can find <font fg=FFA500>4</font> <font fg=FFA500>Elements of Stone</font>, I can craft the <font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font> for you!<br />
