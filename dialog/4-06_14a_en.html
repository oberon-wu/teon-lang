<font fg=FFA500>Water of God</font> comes from the blessing of God of Water, which is extremly rare. But actually, <font fg=FFA500>Water of God</font> can also be crafted. There is a kind of stone called <font fg=FFA500>Element Stone</font>, which is the key for crafting <font fg=FFA500>Water of God</font>.<br />
<br />
However, it's difficult to find the <font fg=FFA500>Element Stone</font>. Maybe you can find them from <font fg=FFA500>Orc</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Orc Fighters</font> near the <font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font>. Bring <font fg=FFA500>Element of Stone</font> <font fg=FFA500>x4</font> to me.<br />
