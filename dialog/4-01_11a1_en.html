<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I've gathered most of what I need except for two very difficult materials. I need your help to find <font fg=FFA500>Water from the Heavens</font> and the <font fg=FFA500>Blessing from the Moon Goddess</font>. <br /> The only person I know who can help you find these materials is the All Knowing <font fg=FFA500> Enialis </font>. Find him and convince him to help you with this task. Only then can the spell work.<font fg=FF0000>(33201,33047)</font> <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?3:21"/> </p>
