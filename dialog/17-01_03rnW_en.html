Those <font fg=FFA500>Beleth Shadow</font> are now wandering near the <font fg=FFA500>Sandwood Oasis</font>. They will suddenly appear and disappear mysteriously, but as long as they show up, it will be very noisy.<br />
<br />
The existence of these dark forces is the barrier that stops future king from regaining the support of people on the Land of Edin.<br />
<br />
I hope you can wipe off these dark monsters for Land of Edin and especially for the villagers who live in Damelot Town and Sandwood Village. Bring one <font fg=FFA500>Beleth Shadow Wand</font> back to me to prove your ability to assist the future king.<br />
