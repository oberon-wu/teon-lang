Oh! You! Hey, you! Yes, I'm calling you! What's your name again?<br />
<br />
Whatever, it doesn't matter. As a scholar, the names of monsters are much easier for me to remember. Oh, but it's not the point.<br />
<br />
What I want to say is that all the adventurers like you are my important partners. And I happen to know an organization that can provide monsters'information especially for you, our partners. That is ---- <font fg=FFA500>Hunter Guild</font>.<br />
<br />
They will provide adventurers with monsters' information. Recently, they need some adventurers to help with their job. <font fg=FFA500>Hunter Guild 2nd Leader</font> is right in this <font fg=FFA500>Maros Town</font>. You can go find him and see whether there are any jobs suitable for you. If you have collected any interesting monster materials during your job, remember to bring them to me.<br />
