I am guessing that from where you came from, the monsters were not that tough, but they are much tougher in Maros. If you want to do better damage, you'd better get a new weapon first.<br />
<br />
I have got <font fg=FFA500>Trainee's Dual Blades</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Trainee's Gauntlet</font> for sale, and they are good choices for a rookie like you. If you think I am ripping you off, you can also go out and hunt for one yourself. Your choice.<br />
