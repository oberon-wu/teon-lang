<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I must warn you that the monsters aren't the most feared, when compared to the fear inside. <br /> A year ago, my friends and I were hunted by King Attila's men! We ran across the Land of Edin and arrived at the Island, but there were just too many of them! Two years ago, my friends encountered them at the Pier. They were caught and beaten to death. I was a coward, hiding and watching them die...I hate myself for it. For the past year, I have been hiding inside this house because I'm afraid of being caught by Attila's men.
