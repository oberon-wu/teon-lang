Okay, I give up. I will tell you everything. (I can't beat you anyway, and I don't want to die)
<br />
<br />
Now, I tell you that I am neither the suspicious person nor the fishman. I'm a pirate!
<br />
<br />
Once upon a time, I heard that there was enough treasure that can buy a whole world burried in somewhere of the sea... 
<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>The castaway pirate started to talk about how he became a pirate.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>The castaway pirate picked up a winebottle with half of rum inside, and talked about his experience of finding the treasure with his friends.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>The castway pirate told you that his own pirates crew came to Maros and they met King Attila's Evil Corps. He keep talking and drinking up the remaining rum in he wine bottle.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
So... Hic! I have to live in this poor pier now!
