Our Trade Union is delegating qualified adventurers with <font fg=FFA500>level 60 or above</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Dark Mithril</font> for us in exchange for experience, Advanced Heroic Potion, and EXP Cube(120% EXP Buff).<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect the Dark Mithril, I need you to submit one <font fg=FFA500>Rare Metal Collect Permit</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Rare Mental Collect Permit</font> to purchase the permit.<br /><br />
