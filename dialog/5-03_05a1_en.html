When I was a little girl, it was still in the dynasty of King Arthur. There is a huge grassland with suffcient supplies.<br />
<br />
Our village is the nearest place of Maros Region, so there were lots of merchants coming through.<br />
<br />
Inside the grassland, there were a castle and a town.<br />
