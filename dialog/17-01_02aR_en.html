It's you, <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>. How can you come here? Do you know the guards outside the cave are the people of Attila?<br />
<br />
I am your elder sister.<br />
<br />
At that time, when my father <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> wanted to build the Tower of Babel, I predicted a huge disaster that would happen in the future through prophecy. I told it to my father, but he was already clouded by desire and power. He didn't listen to me and kept going on his own way.<br />
<br />
After that, Attila attacked the castle. The disaster happened immediately but I couldn't stop it. To make up my mistake, I found Attila, I followed him and tried to change his cruel policy.<br />
