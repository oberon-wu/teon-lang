Unable to carry more items? I can keep it for you. But it'll cost you <font fg=ff0000><var src=#0/></font> gold every time you want to retrieve something.<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>Character Warehouse can only store some bound items. Deleting your character will also delete your Character Warehouse</font><br /><br />
