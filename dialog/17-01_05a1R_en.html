What? You are the...? Sorry, I'm too excited. I've never expected to build legendary items for such a person like you.<br />
<br />
I've heard of those Holy Weapons... But before that, I have one request.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I still cannot confirm your identity... Since I's suspecting of your identity, it's your right to suspect my skill. If you can bring 2 <font fg=FFA500>Lump of Gold</font> to me, I can make a copy of this <font fg=FFA500>Royal Class Certification</font> for you so as to prove my skill.<br />
