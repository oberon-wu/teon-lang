I was known as the <font fg=FFA500>Fearless Knight</font> of <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font>.<br />
<br />
20 years ago, <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> had built <font fg=FFA500>Tower of Babel</font> and angered <font fg=FFA500>God Teon</font>. As a result, the King was to be trapped in his own tower for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Edin</font> descended into chaos with no king. <font fg=FFA500>Attila</font> rose and took control of <font fg=FFA500>Edin</font> among all the other.<br />
