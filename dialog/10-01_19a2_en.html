I used to fight for <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font>, known as the <font fg=FFA500>Fearless Knight</font>. <br /><br />

20 years ago,<font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> had built <font fg=FFA500> Tower of Babel</font> and angered <font fg=FFA500>Teon</font>. As a result, the King was to be trapped in his own tower for the rest of his life.<br />
<br />
Without a king, <font fg=FFA500>Edin</font> descended into chaos. <font fg=FFA500>King Attila</font> then rose and took control of <font fg=FFA500>Edin</font> among all the other kings.
