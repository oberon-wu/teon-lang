I was originally fighting for <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> with the title <font fg=FFA500>Fearless Knight</font>. <br /><br />

20 years ago,<font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> had built <font fg=FFA500> Tower of Babel</font> and cause anger to <font fg=FFA500>Teon</font>, which eventually lead him to be trapped in his own tower.<br />
<font fg=FFA500>King Attila</font> took the opportunity to occupy <font fg=FFA500>Edin</font> and become the new king.
