<font fg=FFFF00>Quest Description:</font><br />
        You found Brooks [Weapon Shop], and was scolded by him. Due to the insufficient storage of weapons, even old weapons will be renewed and refined for the Resistances and the guardians. But he suddenly thought that he can change a new weapon for Swain who is watching the Promise Island Dungeon 2/F. In this way, you can get the old long sword of Swain. So he asked you to bring 10 Iron block for him to craft the new weapon.<br /><br />
