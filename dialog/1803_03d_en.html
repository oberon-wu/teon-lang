<font fg=FFFF00>Quest Description:</font><br />
        You found Brooks [Weapon Shop], and was scolded by him. Due to the insufficient storage of weapons, even old weapons will be renewed and refined for Resistances and the guardians. He suddenly thought of that he can change a new weapon for Swain who is watching the Promise Island Dungeon 2/F. In this way, he can get the old long sword of Swain, so he asked you to bring 10 steel block for him to craft the new weapon.<br /><br />
