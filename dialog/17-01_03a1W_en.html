I knew a brilliant smith in Damelot Town. He can remember all the things he has seen and is also very imaginative. He is able to build the armors he has seen or heard about.<br />
<br />
But, if I'm right, he will not build those highly simbolic armors like the Holy Weapons of King Arthur for you, even though it's not difficult for him. <br />
<br />
To let him accept you, you need to show him something.<br />
