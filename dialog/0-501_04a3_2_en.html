Now, your new recruits are delicated and need to allocate decent weapons and armors.<br /><br />

I have got some <font fg=FFA500>New Recruit Armor</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Spellbook</font>. They are providing to the rookies like you. If you are rash and being killed by monster, I had to train another new recruit. <br />
<br />
I also have an <font fg=FFA500>[Energy Bolt] Spellbook</font>, which you have talent to master it at once, right？<br />
