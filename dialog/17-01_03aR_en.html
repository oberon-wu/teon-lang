I felt very sorry that your meeting with your sister is so hurried. But I think you've heard the information about the Holy Weapons owned by your father <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> from her.<br />
<br />
It's such a pity that we cannot retake the Holy Sword and Armor back, but you need them as a proof of king.<br />
<br />
I think, we can make <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Holy Weapons(Imitation)</font>.<br />
