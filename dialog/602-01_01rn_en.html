Our Chamber of Commerce is delegating qualified adventurers to collect <font fg=FFA500>Venom</font> for us and in exchange for experience and Advanced Heroic Potion.<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect the Venom, I need you to submit one <font fg=FFA500>Animal Collect Permit</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Animal Collect Permit Vendor</font> to purchase the permit.<br />
