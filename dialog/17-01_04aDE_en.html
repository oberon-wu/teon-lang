It's the right time and the needed items are all well-prepared. After you left, I took some time to make this certificate.<br />
<br />
This is <font fg=FFA500>Elven Class Certification</font>. Even thought you look different with other Elven. But it still represents your loyalty to King Arthur's Descent.<br />
<br />
Bring this, along with the <font fg=FFA500>Shadow Knight's Sword</font> you collected to <font fg=FFA500>Damelot Town</font>. Give them to <font fg=FFA500>Upton [Armor Shop]</font>. Yes, he is the brilliant smith I mentioned before.<br />
