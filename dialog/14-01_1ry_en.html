The trial is divided into two parts, which is <font fg=FFA500>Combat Training</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Theoretical Training</font>.<br />
<br />
Notice that you will fail the whole trial if you have one wrong answer in theoretical training!<br />
<br />
If you fails the trial, you need to re-challenge it again. Find me when you are fully prepared!<br />
