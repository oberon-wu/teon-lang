Hello, my friend.<br />
<br />
Chamber of Commerce sell <font fg=FFA500>Animal Collect Permit</font> to the adventurers <font fg=FFA500>less than Lv60</font> every <font fg=FFA500>Tuesday and Thursday</font>. Althrough we aims to provide materials to our investor, we had to set the limited quantities to control the market price.<br />
<br />
You can buy <font fg=FFA500>one</font> permit per day.<br />
<br />
Today no permit is on shelf. You can still accept or continue the ongoing collect task. You can also pay a visit <font fg=FFA500>Hunter Guild</font>.<br />
