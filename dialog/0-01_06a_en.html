Monsters attacked the village again a few days ago. A lot of villagers tried to fight back, but I didn't have enough armor for everyone. Well, now we know why. So many villagers got hurt. My friend Brooks was severely injured and nearly lost his life! <br /><font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I heard that the <font fg=FFA500>Dwarves [near Northern Crossroads of Promise Island Town]</font> use Fire Vines to cure burns. Can you help me find <font fg=FF0000>3</font> of them for Brooks? I'm too busy making armor for the villagers for the next monster attack. Head northeast until you reach the Crossroads and you'll find a dwarf.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:9|navigation?0:32799:32698"/></p>
