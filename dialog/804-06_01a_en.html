Now, we are all prepared! <br />
<br />
Recently, Maros Town is in equipment shortage. We need to find a way to resupply our equipments. <br />
<br />
Our scout consider the <font fg=FFA500>Dwarfs</font> outside our town are annoying and well-equipped. I think we can take some equipments from them.<br />
<br />
Please help me to acquire <font fg=FFA500>20 </font>set of <font fg=FFA500>Dwarf's Armors</font>.<br />
