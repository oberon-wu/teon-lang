Take this <font fg=FFA500>Broad Sword for Swain</font>, go to <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island Dungeon 2/F</font>, and give it to <font fg=FFA500>Swain</font> who is guarding at the entrance of <font fg=FFA500>Old Escape Tunnel</font>. It's time to change to a new weapon as the old one has been used for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Since you want a weapon that beat a lot of monsters, just take the old weapon used by <font fg=FFA500>Swain</font> before. Do you even want me to do that for you, don't you? <br />
