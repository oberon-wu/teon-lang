Deep in the Maros Dungeon 6/F and 7/F, there is a kind of creature mutated by powerful evil magic. We call it <font fg=FFA500>Ghast</font>.<br />
<br />
They seem to have human appearance, but they have very ugly bodies.<br />
<br />
The content of your training is to beat them and collect <font fg=FFA500>20</font> <font fg=FFA500>Mutant's Soul Crystal</font>.<br />
