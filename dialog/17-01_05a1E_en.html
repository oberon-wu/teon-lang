I still cannot accept your request. Only the king with more recognition is qualified to wear the Holy Weapons you said, even though those weapons are some copies.<br />
<br />
But I believe that you are not an ordinary advanturer. The person you support is definitely the king worth Edin people's following. <br />

I will keep your <font fg=FFA500>Elven Class Certification</font>. This is a badge refined from a rare magical crystal. If you can bring 4 <font fg=FFA500>Lump of Mithril</font> to me, I will copy an imitation for you.<br />
<br />
You need to give this imitation to the king worth following. One day, when the king come here with this certificate, I will build the Holy Weapons you said for that person.
