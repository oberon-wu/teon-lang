<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, since you're here, can you help me with something? There is an <font fg=FFA500>Orc</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32693,32762)</font><font fg=FFA500>[Southwestern Sky Island]</font> just standing at the <font fg=FF0000>Northwest corner</font> of this path! At first I thought he was there hoping to kill people traveling there, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Take this Transformation Scroll to turn yourself into an monster. Then you can speak to him and see why he's there, and hopefully you'll manage to ask him to leave. Thanks!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?100:23|navigation?100:32693:32762|video?105"/></p>
