Listen carefully, novice. There are some tricks to deal with these hostile monsters. If you don't want them to attack you, you should try this <font fg=FFA500>Ultimate Scroll of Polymorph</font>.<br />
<br />
To use the scroll: <font fg=FFFF00>Tap Character Portrait > [Bag] > Use the Scroll</font><br />
<br />
You can shapeshift into a monster, and some <font fg=FFFF00>aggressive monsters will no longer attack you onsight...well, unless you hit them first.</font><br />
