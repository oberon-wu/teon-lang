<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, my child, belief will give you the power! Being an Elf, you can get my blessing and is granted Wind, Fire, Water and Earth four different elements magic.<br />
But these four elements resist each other and cannot exist at the same time. If you want to accept my blessing, you can only choose one of them.<br />
After receiving my blessing, you can learn more powerful elemental magic!<br />
