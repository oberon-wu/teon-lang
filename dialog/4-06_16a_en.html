<font fg=FFA500>Sylvia</font> is a very old Elf who used to serve <font fg=FFA500>Elbereth</font> before, and Elbereth is our <font fg=FFA500>Moon Goddess</font>! It's said that Sylvia disappeared after Elbereth died.<br />
<br />
However, some little Elves would meet her occasionally. Hope she is still in the Elven Garden!<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, you are such a kind person, maybe you can help me find <font fg=FFA500>Sylvia</font>.<br />
