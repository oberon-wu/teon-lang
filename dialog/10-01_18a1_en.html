It may be that my friend lost his helmet during the battle and was picked up by this man <font fg=FFA500>Chaotic</font>.<br />
<br />
You can store this helmet in my warehouse. I will let my friends take it away. <br />
<br />
If you are <font fg=FFFF00>unable to carry more items</font>, you can come to me and<font fg=FFFF00>Deposit your item</font>.
