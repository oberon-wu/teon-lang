Among the coming adventurers, someone mentioned that he used to help those peasants defeat and expel the Orcs and other monsters. He should have received the praise from those peasants, but some of the peasants were flustered or even unconcerned about the monsters. It seems like they haven't been hurt by those monsters.<br />
