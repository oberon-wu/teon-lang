Suspicious people? Um... I didn't notice that.<br />
<br />
But, I saw some <font fg=FFA500>House Wives</font> quarrelling with the adventurers.<br />
<br />
As I know, the house wives nearby are very hard-working. They have to earn a living in the town and outside the town, at the same time, they have to stay away from those Orcs. In this case, they are always very kind every time when they meet the adventurers. After all, it is the adventueres who will help them defeat the monsters.<br />
