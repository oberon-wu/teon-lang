Some of high level members in <font fg=FFA500>The Resistance</font> found that the monsters in <font fg=FFA500>Maros Region</font> are having some changes.<br />
<br />
And right now we don't know what may influence the monsters like that. We need someone like you, the new <font fg=FFA500>The Resistance</font> member, yes! I know you are one of the <font fg=FFA500>The Resistance</font>, to help us about this.
