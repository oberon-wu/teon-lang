When <font fg=FFA500>Sir Galahad</font> fell in love with <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font>'s queen, his doom is already set. Perhaps, he himself had seen his own fate too, and chose to hand in himself to the king.<br />
<br />
I was one of the witness, I mean, his execution. It was unforgettable. His soul power, oh, such pure soul power, evaporating from his body in the heat of the flame.<br />
<br />
And pure soul attracts Wraiths. It could be corrupted easily.<br />
