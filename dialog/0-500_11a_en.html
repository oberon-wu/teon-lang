Not far on the <font fg=FFFF00>Southwest</font>, there is a fearsome monster called the <font fg=FFA500>Drake</font>.<br />
<br />
We have been trying to fight it but our efforts were futile. Fortunately, we found that the <font fg=FFA500>Drake Servants</font> it summoned possess some powerful crystals, the <font fg=FFA500> Servant Soul Crystal</font>.<br />
<br />
We need your help to defeat <font fg=FFA500>Drake Servant</font>, and collect <font fg=FFA500> Servant Soul Crystal</font> <font fg=FF0000>x3</font>, so that we could use its own power to fight it back.<br />
