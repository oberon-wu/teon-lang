Not far on the West, there is a fearful monster called <font fg=FFA500>Drake</font>.<br />
He is so powerful, and have the ability to summon his servants. We have been trying to defeat  him for so long and have not caused any harm to him. He is able to summon his servants from the dark.<br /><br />
Now we can only hold him so that he can't move, but he is still able to attack nearby people.<br />We need your help to defeat <font fg=FFA500>Drake Servant</font>, and collect <font fg=FFA500>3</font> <font fg=FFA500>Servant Soul Crystal</font>.<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>Standing near or attack Drake can cause him to summon his servants</font><br />
