Adventurer, I can refine elemental source crystal for you.<br />
I can also do elemental enchant for your weapons by using elemental source crystal.<br />
When the Apocalyptic Power of weapons is insufficient, you can purchase Pure Apocalyptic Source Crystal from me to add more power to your weapons.<br />
