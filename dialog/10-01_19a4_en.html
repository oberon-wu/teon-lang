It was only in recent years that when I studied the information left by the <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>, I slowly recover my memory. I found out that the <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>, was the great mage whom always stay beside the king, <font fg=FFA500>Merlin</font>.<br />
The <font fg=FFA500>Old Book</font> that you have found, some of them are the ones that he left when he was in <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island</font>.<br />
