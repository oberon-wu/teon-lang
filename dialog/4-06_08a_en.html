Recently, <font fg=FFA500>Orc</font> started to be active outside the Elven Garden again. Over the years, have they already forgotten the pain of defeat?<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, please go outside the Elven Garden, to the North-West of Orcish Region, and help me prevent those <font fg=FFA500>Orc Fighters</font> from sliping into our garden.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Orc Fighters</font> may wear <font fg=FFA500>Orc Leader's Letter</font> with them, please inform <font fg=FFA500>Antinua</font> after getting it.<br />
