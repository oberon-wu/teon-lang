Want an old sword as collection? Collection!? Are you crazy?<br />
<br />
Do you know the guardians of Promise Village who are fighting against the monsters every single day? Do you know the people who go to Land of Edin and revolt the King Attila? They all need the better weapons! Even though it is a broken sword, refine it and it can also be powerful!<br />
<br />
How dare you put the weapon into a box for pleasure? This is a great disrespect to weapon smith! Get out!<br />
