For you see, my strength and courage are tied to the weapon that I bare. In a great battle my weapon was broken when I used it to shield a friend. From that day forth, I too became broken. I see it in your eyes that you will not take no for an answer. Perhaps it is fate that brought you to me and it is indeed my time to return. I will need a new weapon, one that I can tame and make my own. Only then will my strength and courage return! <br />
There are <font fg=FFA500>Hobgoblins near the southwest part of Promise Island Town</font>. Find them and bring me back <font fg=FF0000>2</font> Broken Blades from Hobgoblins. I will forge a new weapon for myself from them!<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:15"/></p>
