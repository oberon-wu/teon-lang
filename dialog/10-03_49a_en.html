We have finally discovered the evil behind the recent activities of <font fg=FFA500>Undeads</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Orcs</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Goblins</font>.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Casey</font>, the former High Priest in <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island Town</font>, was expelled few years ago by <font fg=FFA500>Dellas</font>. <font fg=FFA500>Casey</font> was suspected in practicing <font fg=FFA500>Dark Magic</font> described in some of the books left behind by the <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>, trying to manipulate monsters and conspired in necromancy.<br />
<br />
The recent acts of the monsters showed high relevance to <font fg=FFA500> Casey's</font> former practice.
