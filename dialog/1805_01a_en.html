Welcome, adventurer!<br />
<br />
Did you bring <font fg=FFA500>Red Crystal</font> or <font fg=FFA500>Blue Crystal</font>? Oh, it seems like you are not a <font fg=FFFF00>Monster Hunter</font> yet. I suppose that you cannot even obtain these two kinds of crystal I mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you want to become a <font fg=FFA500>Monster Hunter</font>, you need to complete the following quests:<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Hunting Information (Accetable after level 41)</font><br />
<font fg=FFA500>Monster Hunter (Accetable after completing the Hunting Information Quest)</font><br />
<br />
<a link="1805_01a1">Ask for the intelligence about the suspicious people</a><br />
<br />
<a link="Hunt_Info">Learn more about the Ymir and Jokul</a><br />
<br />
Even though you don't have any crystal, but you can also participate in <font fg=FFA500>Crystal Prize</font> to see what prizes you can get.<br />
