In the world of Teon, eliminating opponents (taking out hostile players or being taken out by other players) is considered a part of the game content instead of harassment.While playing the game, a player has to activate the PvP mode to attack another player. When a player takes out another, it leaves a system record which modifies the attacker's Justice Points. Meanwhile, there are sanctuaries in the game where PvP activities are forbidden.<br />
We do not judge how do players behave in PvP activities. If, however, such activities have severely affected your normal gaming experience,you may contact a GM and we will handle accordingly as the case might be.<br /><br /><br />
