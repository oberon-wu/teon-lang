Welcome, adventurer!<br />
<br />
Do you have any <font fg=FFA500>Red Crystal</font> or <font fg=FFA500>Blue Crystal</font>? Oh, it's seems you are not a <font fg=FFFF00>Monster Hunter</font> yet. I guess you couldn't acquire any of this crystal that I mentioned.<br />
<br />
If you want to become a <font fg=FFA500>Monster Hunter</font>, you need to accomplish the following quests:<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Hunting Information (acceptable when reached Lv.41)</font><br />
<font fg=FFA500>Monster Hunter（acceptable after accomplish Hunting Information）</font><br />
<br />

<br />
Althought you don't have any crystals that I mentioned, but you can still check the rewards of <font fg=FFA500>Crystal Prize</font>.<br />
