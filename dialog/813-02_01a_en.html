Adventurer, Orianna just mention about the shortage of material supplies. And she want you to acquire Ungoliant's Thread. <br />
<br />
I also need someone to help us to acquire <font fg=FFA500>Ungoliant's Fang</font> x20 and return to me. <br />
<br />
Could you please help us about this? We will offer you worthy rewards after you complete the quest. And just as Orianna said, the Ungoliant is living solitary, so you need to find that by yourself. <br />
<br />
