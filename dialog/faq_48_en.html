<font fg=FFA500>Loot Collection:</font><br />
<br />
1. Killing another player gives you a chance to snatch his / her valuable items as your loot.<br />
<br />
2. The content of the loot is unknown to you. The original owner has 120 minutes to decide whether to pay the ransom (Teon Coins) or give up the loot to you.<br />
<br />
3. If the original owner did not pay the ransom within 120 minutes, the loot will be revealed and you will be able to collect the loot within 24 hours. The time will constantly count even the character offline.<br />
<br />
4. If the original owner paid the ransom (80% of the ransom or 85% of the ransom for Premium Members), you will be able to collect part of the ransom within 24 hours but the content of the loot will not be revealed to you.<br />
<br />
5. Either the loot or the ransom must be collected within 24 hours (starting after the 120-minutes decision time).<br />
