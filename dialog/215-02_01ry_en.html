Thank you very much!<br /><br />
With these <font fg=FFA500>Potion of Haste</font>, the guards will be better at protecting themselves against monsters.<br />
This is a little thank you. It is the remaining <font fg=FFA500>Healing Potion</font> that was used to treat the wounded guards before. I hope it may help you later.<br />
