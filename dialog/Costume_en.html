<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>ï¼ŒI have been designing personalized costumes for villagers. If you have Magical Dyes, you can redeem costumes from me.<br /> To help you know more about costumes, I will give you 10 Magical Dyes for free. <br /> If you are a subscribed member, you could also receive extra 15 more dyes. You will also be able to redeem member exclusive costumes.<br /><br />
1. Magical Dyes can redeem costumes in different combinations for different durations<br />
2. Special Magical Dyes can redeem specific costumes in specific combinations<br />
3. For each character there are 3 slots of costumes. The default costume cannot be modified<br />
