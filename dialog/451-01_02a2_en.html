Use a <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Enchant Trainee's Armor</font> to enchant any piece of your <font fg=FFA500>Trainee's Armor</font> <font fg=FFFF00>from +0 to +1</font>. Once you are done, come back to talk to me again. I will then enchant one of your other piece from +0 to +1 as a reward to your effort.
