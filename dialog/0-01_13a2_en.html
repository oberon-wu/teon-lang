<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, you are the hope of Edin. It is a heavy burden to bear, but it is fate!<br />I believe you will be able to face it. 
Head <font fg=FF0000>Northeast</font> until you pass the mountain ridge, then continue Southeast in Promise Island until you find a <font fg=FFA500>Pet Farm</font>. There are some monsters in the area, but none seem to attack the Farm. This tells me that there must some sort of secret magical power, one that might help you with your destiny! The owner is <font fg=FFA500>Carina</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32720,32858)</font><font fg=FFA500>[Pet Farm, Southeastern Promise Island]</font>. She might know what the secret is. Go and talk to her and you might learn something!
