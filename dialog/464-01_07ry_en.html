Thanks to God of Teon!<br />
<br />
I wasn't thinking anyone could did that! Any one of those two monsters are powerful enough to destroy and wipe out our entire <font fg=FFA500>Escon Town</font>. <br />
<br />
But you did kill it and bring me that <font fg=FFA500>Token of Monster Leader</font>!<br />
<br />
Here's your rewards for this heroical behavior! <br />
