Oh, please wait.<br />
Seeing this <font fg=FFA500>Treasure Map</font>, it reminds me of something. I have a similar map in my warehouse. I didn't think it could be a treasure map. But the map is very old, and I'm not sure whether it is the same treasure map as the pirate said.<br />
<br />
Take it and show it to <font fg=FFA500>Castaway Pirate [Treasure]</font>. If it also is a <font fg=FFA500>Treasure Map</font>, you can just take it as the apology for my mistake.<br />
