<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I've collected most of the materials for this Fog Magic, except for the Fog Spell's Stone Heart and other two very rare materials that I need you to find.<br />
<br />
One is the <font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font> and one is the <font fg=FFA500>Moon Goddess Blessing</font> from our race eudemon Elbereth.<br />
<br />
I have no idea where to get these two materials from, but maybe the knowledgeable <font fg=FFA500>Enialis</font> would know it...<br />
