<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I've collected most of the materials for Fog Barrier. Except the Core of Fog Barrier, you need to find another two materials.<br />
<br />
The first one is the <font fg=FFA500>Water of God</font> and the other is the <font fg=FFA500>Moon Goddess Blessing</font> from our race eudemon Elbereth.<br />
<br />
I have no idea where these two materials are, but maybe the knowledgeable <font fg=FFA500>Enialis</font> would know it...<br />
