<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, people store their belongings here with me, as it's safe and well guarded. If you like, you can store your items with me here as well. Just come and talk to me if you want to do so. <font fg=FFA500>Justina</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32770,32713)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Promise Island Town Storage]</font> doesn't trust me and keeps all her belongings. I heard that she was recently robbed. If you head <font fg=FF0000>Northwest</font> you'll find her. She could use your help, I bet.<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:3"/></p>
