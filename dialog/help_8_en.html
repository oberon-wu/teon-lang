<font fg=ffffaf>Trade: In the game, players can trade in-game items and gold with other players freely. In Teon, many items and resources are tradable.</font><br /><br />

<font fg=ffffaf>How to Trade</font><br />
1. Start a trade: Tap on the player portrait and select Trade in the drop-down menu.<br />
2. Add items: Tap and hold an item then drag it into the trade window.<br />
3. Lock items: Once locked, the items in the trade window cannot be changed again. Now wait for the other party to lock their items.<br />
4. Confirm Trade: When both parties have locked and checked the items in the trade window, they can complete the trade by taping on confirm button.<br />
5 Cancel trade: Close the trade window to cancel the trade.<br /><br />

<font fg=ffffaf>Important Information</font><br />
1. Any trade completed in the game is irreversible. We strongly recommend players to use extra cautions while trading with others to avoid unnecessary losses<br />
2. If the trade fails and your backpack is full, the overweighted items will drop to the ground.<br />
