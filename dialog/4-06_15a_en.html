<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, the <font fg=FFA500>God of Water</font> has been crafted, but it is very unstable and not easy to store. Please give it to <font fg=FFA500>Heian</font> as soon as possible!<br />
<br />
What's more, as for the <font fg=FFA500>Moon Goddess Blessing</font>, you can tell <font fg=FFA500>Heian</font> that it's <font fg=FFA500>Sylvia</font>. He will get it.<br />
