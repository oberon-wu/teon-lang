<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, we elves are blessed by this land and have Wind, Fire, Water, and Earth magic.<br />
These four elements, however, can't exist simultaneously. As a result, you can only receive the blessing of one element at a time.<br />
You can learn more powerful elemental spells once you've been blessed by elves!<br />
