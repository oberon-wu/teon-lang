A long time ago, there were only happiness and freedom in Elven Garden, without any trouble nor disputes between each other. <br />
But the good times has gone, a group of ugly orcs broke in, with heir brute force, killing and started occupying the southeast forest, building city fence, invading our peaceful Elven Garden. <br /> 
They also plunder our food and resources, insulting us elves, and often brings up war against my family to satisfy their desires!
