At <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island 2/F</font>, in <font fg=FFA500>The Room with Sealed Baphomet</font>, there are some <font fg=FFA500>Dungeon Slaughterer</font> come from the Abyss. They are trying to break the seal of Baphomet and summon the evil monster to this Promise Island again.<br />
<br />
Also, some <font fg=FFA500>Tunnel Slaughterer</font> are ready in the <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Tunnel</font> connected to the <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island Dungeon 2/F</font>.<br />
<br />
I hope you can wipe off these dark monsters for the Land of Edin and the villagers on Promise Island. Bring one <font fg=FFA500>Spear of Dungeon Slaughterer</font> and one long spear of <font fg=FFA500>Tunnel Slaughterer</font> back to me. These can prove that you are a capable king that can bring people the light.<br />
