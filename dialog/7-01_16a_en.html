It's highly possible that someone caused the revive of the <font fg=FFA500>Phoenix</font>.<br />
<br />
The key about this is our dwarven relic: <font fg=FFA500>the Golden Goat Fur</font>.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you more about this. Maybe you can ask the elder <font fg=FFA500>Tyrano</font>.<br />
