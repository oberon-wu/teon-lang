My king, it's the right time and the needed items are all well-prepared. When you leave, I took some time to make this certificate.<br />
<br />
This is <font fg=FFA500>Royal Class Certification</font>. It represents your loyalty to King Arthur's Descent.<br />
<br />
Bring this, <font fg=FFA500>Spear of Dungeon Slaughterer</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Spear of Tunnel Slaughterer</font> you collected to <font fg=FFA500>Damelot Town</font>. Give them to <font fg=FFA500>Upton[Armor Shop]</font>. Yes, he is the brilliant smith I mentioned before.<br />
