For the safety of the villagers, we need to get rid off both the <font fg=FFA500>Deceased Villagers</font>.<br />
<br />
By the way, those <font fg=FFA500>Deceased Villagers</font> used to be, well you know, one of us. So, if you come across any <font fg=FFA500>Family Token</font>, bring <font fg=FF0000>6</font> of them to me.<br />
<br />
Just a friendly reminder: you should use <font fg=FFFF00> Scroll of Polymorph</font>, so that they <font fg=FF0000>won't be hostile against you</font>.
