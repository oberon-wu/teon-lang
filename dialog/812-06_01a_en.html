Now, we are all prepared! <br />
<br />
Recently, Maros Town is in material shortage. We need to find a way to resupply. <br />
<br />
Our scout consider the <font fg=FFA500>Ungoliant</font> outside our town may fit with one of particular request.<br />
<br />
Please help me to acquire <font fg=FFA500>10</font> <font fg=FFA500>Ungoliant's Thread</font>. Ungoliant is living solitary. So you may need to find them by yourself.<br />
