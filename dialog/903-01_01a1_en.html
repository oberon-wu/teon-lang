<font fg=FFA500>Rufus[Collect]</font> asked me to tell others to bring him <font fg=FFA500>Heart of Stone Golem x10</font>. He said I'd get an apple if you told him that I told you.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can find them from <font fg=FFA500>Golems</font>, but if you did find the hearts, tell <font fg=FFA500>Rufus[Collect]</font> that I was the one who told you! He promised to give me apples if I spread the words for him.<br />
