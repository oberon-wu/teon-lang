Since Sandwood has turned into a desert, the monsters began occupying Damelot Dungeon.<br />

For many years we have been trying to defeat the monsters, but no matter what, we can't kill them. <br />

Now we also use the Damelot Dungeon as a trial place for warriors. To become a true warrior, you need to survive in the dungeon.<br /><br />



First, head to <font fg=FFA500>Damelot Dungeon 1F</font> to defeat <font fg=FFA500>Bladeling</font> and collect <font fg=FFA500>Blade of Bladeling</font>. <br />
