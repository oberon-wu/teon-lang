Look, it's quite inconvenient for me to find these spies with such an old body. Also, since I don't look like an adventurer, if I inquire the information rashly, it will alert the enemies.<br />
<br />
It cannot be better if you can inquire the citizens, see whether there are any <font fg=FFA500>Intelligences of Werid People</font>, come back and analyze the situation with me.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFFF00>Now you can open your Quest Bar, and check the acceptable side quest.<br />
<br />
After collecting the following information, come back and find Mysterious Mage:<br />
Intelligence From Batta [Item Shop]<br />
Intelligence From Trainee Buffer<br />
Intelligence From Taka [Warehouse]<br />
Intelligence From Servant [Inn]<br />
Intelligence From Lucy [Crystal Blessing]<br />
Intelligence From Apocalypser</font><br />
