We need to find out if all of these are truely happening.<br />

Defeat <font fg=FFA500>Zombies</font> and collect some <font fg=FFA500>Soul Crystals</font> for us to study. I will need <font fg=FF0000>15</font> of them.<br />
<br />
Also, chop down some <font fg=FFA500>Man-Eaters</font> to see what has made them evolve. I will need probably <font fg=FF0000>3</font> samples of whatever you can find from them.<br />
<br />
Don't forget your <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Polymorph</font>. It will make your mission a lot easier.
