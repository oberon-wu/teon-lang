A year ago, my husband and his companions were attacked by monsters when they went for hunting. Although they successfully escaped, my husband left me and passed away because of the severe injuries that he had suffered. <br />
Later on, some villagers saw my husband around the village. They said that he stood still and did not move, and disappeared as soon as they tried to approached him. <br />
The old man in the village said that because he is the only one who died, his heart was unwilling, so his soul was bound upon this village. <br />
