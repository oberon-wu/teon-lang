Adventurer, I can pray to the gods so that you can regain some of your lost EXP during your last defeat in battle (2% EXP of current level)<br />
but you must meet the following requirement: <br />
1. Your last defeat was in member zone, except special regions such as Cave of Evil. <br />
2. You were defeated by monsters, except bosses or event monsters. <br />
3. You were not defeated by poison. <br />
4. You must come to me within 2 hours since your defeat, and I can only recover your EXP twice a day. <br />
5. The cost of recovery will increase base on your level. <br /><br />
