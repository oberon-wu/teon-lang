Greeting, <font fg=FFA500>Eva Guardian</font>.<br />
<br />
We had received a urgent information from our scout. <br />
<br />
There are some abnormal phenomena in the <font fg=FFA500>Eva Castle</font>. The monster lived in there are being aggressive once again, and some of them are already attacking our town!<br />
<br />
So I'm looking for someone to collect the detailed information to help us deal with the situation. Would you mind to help us collect <font fg=FFA500>Information of Eva Castle's 1/F Monsters</font> x 40?<br />
<br />
Monsters in Eva Castle's 1/F should have this information.<br />
