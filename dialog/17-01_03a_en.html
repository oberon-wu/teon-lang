I guess you have heard about the information of the holy weapons owned by the <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> from <font fg=FFA500>Cassandra</font>.
<br />
It's such a pity that right now we are not able to get Holy Sword and Armor back, but our future king really need them.<br />
<br />
I think, we can make <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Holy Weapons(Imitation)</font> instead.<br />
