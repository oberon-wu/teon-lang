Adventurer, as you can see, I'm an Alchemist.Recently, there's something wrong with my research. It brings a lot of troubles! That is ---- I can't find the research direction! If you can bring me some golden items with magic or inherited some spirit, maybe I will be inspired of these. Don't worry, I just want to have a look, and I won't take your belongings. <font fg=FFFF00>(Bring one Ring of Heroism to the Alchemist)</font><br />
