It's hopeless to find these weapons back.<br />
<br />
Except you, I also have <font fg=FFA500>another guest</font> waiting, a <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>. He is in deep inside of this cave.<br />
<br />
He is a sage, the guide of the future king. He can guide you to help the future king find the weapons back. Go, don't waste the time. Before being discovered by people of Attila, talk to that <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font> and leave as soon as possible.<br />
