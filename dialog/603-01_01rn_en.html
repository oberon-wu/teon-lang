Our Chamber of Commerce is delegating powerful adventurers with <font fg=FFA500>level 59 or below</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Lump of Gold</font> for in exchange for experience and Advanced Heroic Potion.<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect the Lump of Gold, I need you to submit <font fg=FFA500>Metal Collect Permit x1</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Metal Collect Permit Vendor</font> to purchase the permit.<br />
