Hello, Eva Guardian.<br />
<br />
If we can acquire more detailed information about the monsters in <font fg=FFA500>MirrorForest</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Eva Castle</font>, and <font fg=FFA500>Seabed</font>. We may have an idea to set back those monsters for a period time and give us a break in this long time of battle.<br />
<br />
But as I said, we need more Info.<br />
