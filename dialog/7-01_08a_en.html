Honestly, I don't know a lot about the abnormal mana flow.<br />
<br />
There is a rumor that the <font fg=FFA500>Phoenix</font> will revive every 1 thousand years. Every time it revives, it will cause the abnormal mana flow.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Vani</font> should know more about this, you can go to ask him.<br />
