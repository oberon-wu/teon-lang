For someone ordinary like me, staying in the safe zone is the way to go. I get to enjoy life and I don't have to worry about being attacked or even killed! <br /> For those hanging out in the normal zone, they have to worry about monsters and strangers all the time and might get themselves killed! <br />As for those in the danger zone...I think they've stopped caring about death.<br />
