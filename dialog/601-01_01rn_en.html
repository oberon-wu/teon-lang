Our Trade Union is delegating qualified adventurers with <font fg=FFA500>level 59 or below</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Leather</font> for us in exchange for experience and Advanced Hero Potion.<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect the Leather, I need you to submit one <font fg=FFA500>Animal Collect Permit</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Animal Collect Permit</font> to purchase the permit.<br />
