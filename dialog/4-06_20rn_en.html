<font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font> is in the South-East of Land of Nature. From here to the South-Ease, pass through the Elven Garden and Orcish Region, then you can reach the Orc Town. It would be quite dangerous on your way to the Orc Town, be careful!<br />
<br />
You can also use <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Escape</font>. Use it in the Land of Nature and you will be teleported to the <font fg=FFA500>Orcish Guild</font>. Then, you can find the Teleporter and you are able to reach the Orc Town! Or you can also keep going to the South-West from the southwest gate of <font fg=FFA500>Orcish Guild</font>, and you can also reach the <font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font> and find <font fg=FFA500>Lum</font>.<br />
