Monsters have become more active recently. I'm worried about what Attila is planning. We need to do something before it gets worse.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>The Resistance</font> is going to eliminate those monsters and will reward whoever has contributed. During the period of our action from October 19th to November 16th, you can get Monsters' Token from every monster you killed. Give them to me to get your reward.<br />
