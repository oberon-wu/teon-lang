We plan to enter the Maros Dungeon and put an end to the Death Knight and his minions! Our scout told us that the Death Knight is able to summoned Death Knight' Servants, which are evil creatures powered by the soul of the Death Knight! If you can slay a Death Knight' Servant and collect <font fg=FF0000>1</font> <font fg=FFA500>Death Knight soul Essence</font> from it, it will further weaken the Death Knight! <br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?2:29"/></p>
