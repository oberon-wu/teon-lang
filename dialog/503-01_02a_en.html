These special monsters are different from the normal monsters. Some of them are the leader of a group, some are the crazy mages, some are the ancient creatures, and some even are the incarnation of grievance. They have powerful strength and each of them can defeat hundreds of enemies! Our Hunter Guild keeps trying to obtain more information about them, but all in vain. We don't expect you to defeat all of them, but you can bring the information of one of the special monsters.<br />
<br />
You only need to find and defeat the one random special monster (Lord) in the following and you will have a chance to obtain <font fg=FFA500>Information About Special Monsters</font>ï¼š<br />

<font fg=FFA500>Endor</font><br />

<font fg=FFA500>Drake</font><br />
