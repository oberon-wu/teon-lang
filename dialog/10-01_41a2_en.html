There are a lot of <font fg=FFA500>Shelob</font> around here.<br />
They will prevent us from hunting more orcs in the future. <br />
Defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Shelob</font> and bring back <font fg=FF0000>5</font> <font fg=FFA500>Shelob Legs</font> as a proof to me.<br />
Use your new equipment and enchanted weapon, their shells are much harder than you think.<br />
