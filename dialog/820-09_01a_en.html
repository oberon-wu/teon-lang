It's seem the shadow of the chaos storm is being more closer!  <br />
<br />
We need to be prepared for this. <font fg=FFA500>Karguk</font> ask me to prepare some weapons for him.<br />
<br />
Now the weapons are ready. And I think you need to check on the preparation in <font fg=FFA500>Agrob</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Dura</font>.<br />
<br />
Also, please tell <font fg=FFA500>Karguk</font> the weapons are ready after you check <font fg=FFA500>Agrob</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Dura</font>.<br />
