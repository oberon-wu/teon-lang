Countless of our soldiers died in their hands, and their name tag have been taken away by those ruthless orcs and become their trophies.<br />
<br />
I need you to defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Invading Orcs</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Invading Orc Fighters</font>. Retrieve <font fg=FFA500>Name Tag</font> <font fg=FF0000>x6</font>.<br />
<br />
This is the only way to regain our soldiers' honor.<br />
