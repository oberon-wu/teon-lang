In spite of this, it is still the last fortress of King Arthur's dynasty and it is the place where the supporters of future king's gather.<br />
<br />
So Attila strengthened the deployment of <font fg=FFA500>Shadow Knight</font> in <font fg=FFA500>Sandwood</font> and sent many <font fg=FFA500>Shadow Knight Leaders</font> to patrol that region.<br />
<br />
I hope you can wipe off these barriers for our future king. Defeat a <font fg=FFA500>Shadow Knight Leader</font> and bring one <font fg=FFA500>Shadow Knight's Sword</font> back to prove your ability to assist our future king.<br />
