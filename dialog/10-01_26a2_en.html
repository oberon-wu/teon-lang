I heard that <font fg=FFA500>Owen</font> was accidentally bitten by the spiders during his mission.<br />
Right now, he is recovering in <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island Town</font>. Would you take this <font fg=FFA500>Cure Poison Potion</font> to himï¼Ÿ<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Cure Poison Potion</font> can also be purchase from <font fg=FFA500>Justina [Item shop]</font> if you happened to lose it.<br />
Take this <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Escape</font>, you can use it to be teleport directly to the town.<br />
