At ancient times, Humans, Orcs, Elves, Undeads and Demons had raged war against each other.<br />
Wars lasted for generations and generations, and the Humans won in the end. To celebrate the victory of the Ancient Wars, the Human Sages ordered a great festival to be held annually -- The New World Celebration.<br />
At the day of the Celebration, there will be processions, plays, games, sports, and campfire feasts.<br />
