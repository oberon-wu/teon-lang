Eighteen years have passed since monsters started to invade the <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island</font>. It was a miracle that not only the villagers have survived but they have also formed a respectable army.<br />
<br />
But things are changing. I am afraid that we will be involved in a much, much bigger war which affects not only the island but the entire <font fg=FFA500> Land of Edin</font>.<br />
