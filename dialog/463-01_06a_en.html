Greeting, <font fg=FFA500>Eva Guardian</font>.<br />
<br />
We had received a urgent information from our scout. <br />
<br />
There are some abnormal phenomena in the <font fg=FFA500>Sea Bed</font>. The monster lived in there are being aggressive once again, and some of monster of <font fg=FFA500>MirrorForest</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Eva Castle</font> are already attacking our town under the monster of <font fg=FFA500>Sea Bed</font> leading!<br />
<br />
So I'm looking for someone to collect the detailed information to help us deal with the situation. Would you mind to help us collect <font fg=FFA500>Information of Sea Bed's Unique Monsters</font> x 20?<br />
<br />
The Seabed's Monsters are including <font fg=FFA500>Aboleth</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Kopru</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Ixitxachitl</font>, and <font fg=FFA500>Dragon_Turtle</font>. But sometime there are some of Eva Castle's monsters will go to the <font fg=FFA500>Seabed</font> but they are not our target.<br />
