These Orcs are highly intelligent and sociable as human beings! This totally changed my vision to <font fg=FFFF00>Monsters</font>... No, maybe they are not monsters at all. They have belief too, and it comes from the ancient myth we all know -- the myth of Teon!<br />
<br />
But we know only a little about their history which is merely hearsay. To get deeper into their history, I need to collect some totems that are not normal but <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Totem</font>.<br />
