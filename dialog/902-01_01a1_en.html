These Orcs are highly intelligent and sociable as human beings! This totally changed my vision to <font fg=FFFF00>Monsters</font>... No, maybe they are not monsters at all.<br />
<br />
They have beliefs too, and their beliefs also come from the ancient myth we all know--the myth of Teon!<br />
<br />
But we know only a little about their history which is merely hearsay. To get deeper into their history, I need to collect some totems that are not normal but <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Totem</font>.<br />
<br />
It is said that the Orcs in <font fg=FFA500>Elven Dungeon</font> would wear the totems that can bring them tremendous strength. As long as you can bring some to me, um... I have <font fg=FFFF00>sufficient research funding</font>. For every <font fg=FFA500>20</font> <font fg=FFA500>Ancient Totem</font>, I can pay you <font fg=FFA500>5000 Gold</font> and <font fg=FFA500>4</font> <font fg=FFA500>Fruit of World Tree</font>.<br />
