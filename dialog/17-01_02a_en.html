Your surprising visit lets me forget the greetings. Let me introduce myself first. My name is <font fg=FFA500>Cassandra</font>, as people know, I am one of the daughters of <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font>.<br />
<br />
At that time, when my father <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> wanted to build the Tower of Babel, I predicted a huge disaster that would happen in the future through prophecy. I told it to my father, but he was already blinded by desire and power. He didn't listen to me and kept going on his own way.<br />
<br />
After that, Attila launch an attack on the castle. The disaster happened immediately but I couldn't stop it. To make up my mistake, I found <font fg=FFA500>Attila</font>, I followed him and tried to change his cruel policy.<br />
