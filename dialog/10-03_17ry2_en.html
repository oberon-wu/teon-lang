It may be that my friend lost his helmet during the battle and was picked up by this man <font fg=FFA500>Chaotic</font>.<br />
<br />
You can store this helmet in my warehouse. I will return it to my friend. <br />
<br />
If you are <font fg=FFFF00>carrying too many items</font>, you can <font fg=FFFF00>deposit your item</font> here.
