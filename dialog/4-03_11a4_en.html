去马洛斯城北方沼泽打<font fg=FFA500>Swamp Zombie and Swamp Ghoul</font>.The Death Knight is hiding somewhere in the Maros Dungeon! He's surrounded by skeleton warriors and undead knights! I believe he may have hidden one his own bones among them! This is the source of his corruption and power! If he is incomplete he will be weakened! Many have tried and failed to find it, but I hope that you will succeed! Fight them and retrieve <font fg=FF0000>1</font> piece of <font fg=FFA500>Death Knight's Bone</font>. I will keep far from the Death Knight so he will be weakened!<br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?2:21"/></p>
