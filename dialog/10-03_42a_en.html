You are so talented in combat, so you should follow <font fg=FFA500> Dellas</font> and go to the <font fg=FFA500>Land of Edin</font> in the future.<br />
<br />
In that case, I think you should meet <font fg=FFA500>Brooks [Weapon Shop]</font> and let him take a look at your weapon. <br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Brooks [Weapon Shop]</font> is in <font fg=FFA500>Promise Village</font>, go back and pay a visit to him as soon as possible.<br />
