You are so talented in combat. Are you going to follow <font fg=FFA500> Dellas</font> and head to the <font fg=FFA500>Land of Edin</font> in the future?<br />
<br />
In that case, I think you need to find <font fg=FFA500>Brooks [Weapon Shop]</font> and let him take a look at your weapon. <br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Brooks [Weapon Shop]</font> is in <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island Town</font>, go back and pay him a visit.
