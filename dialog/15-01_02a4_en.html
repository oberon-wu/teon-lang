What do you feel after listening, hic, this <font fg=FFFF00>Thrilling</font> sea adventure story? Do you want to go on treasure hunt too, don't you? It's said that the treasure that can buy the whole world was burried right nearby the <font fg=FFA500>Maros</font>!
<br />
<br />
In fact, I still have a lot of <font fg=FFA500>Treasure Maps</font> found in the past. They should have been my treaure, but I need some money to rebuild my pirate group! I can sell these to you! How about this? You give me the money, and I'll give you the treasure. That's a good deal, right?

<font fg=FFFF00>It seems like this pirate is not the spotter of <font fg=FFA500>King Attila</font>. Purchase a <font fg=FFA500>Treasure Map</font> from him as the evidence. Come back and report it to <font fg=FFA500>Karol</font>.</font>
