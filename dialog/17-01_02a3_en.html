I'm afraid that it's hopeless to find these weapons back.<br />

Except for you, I still have <font fg=FFA500>another guest</font>, a <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>. He is deep inside this cave.<br />

He is a sage, the guider of the future king. He can guide you to help the future king to find the weapons back. Go on, don't waste the time. Before being found out by Attila's men, talk to that <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font> and leave as soon as possible.<br />
