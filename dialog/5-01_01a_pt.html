Gol has ordered a Mithril Long Sword from me. I already have it forged. Ah, look at this beauty, the fine touching on the edge... <br />It's a pity that I can't deliver her to Gol myself, because those god-forsaken werewolves have bitten my legs! <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, I need to ask you for a favor. Could you please take her to Gol for me?<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10557.8 link="5-01_01a1" /></p>
