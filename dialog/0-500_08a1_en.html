You can shapeshift into a monster, and some <font fg=FFFF00>aggressive monsters will no longer attack you onsight...well, unless you hit them first.</font><br />
<br />
Take the <font fg=FFA500>Ultimate Scroll of Polymorph</font>, and shapeshift into a <font fg=FFA500>Death Knight</font>.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>Death Knight</font> is the strongest shape among all others and requires level 50 before you can fully control its power.<br />
<br />
To use the scroll: <font fg=FFFF00>Tap Character Portrait > [Bag] > Use the Scroll</font><br />
<br />
Speak with me again after you shapeshift into a <font fg=FFA500>Death Knight</font>.<br />
