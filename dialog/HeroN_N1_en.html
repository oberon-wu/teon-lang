Monsters have become more active recently. I'm worried about what Attila is planning. We need to do something before it gets worse.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>The Resistance is going to eliminate those monsters and will reward whoever has contributed. During the period of our action from October 19th to November 16th, you can get Monsters' Token from every monster you killed. Give them to me to get your reward.<br />
<br />	
Do you want an advanced <font fg=FFA500>Amulet of Heroism</font>? If you want to upgrade it, you should collect enough <font fg=FFA500>Hero Emblem</font>, and put the amulet in your Bag before you upgrade it. <br />
<br />
Amulet of Heroism will be unbind when it is <font fg=FFA500>Lv4</font>.</font><br />
Hero Emblem can be buy in the Mall. And the Advanced Hero Emblem can be acquire from Boss drop or future activities.<br />
