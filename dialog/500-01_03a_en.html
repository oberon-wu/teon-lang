Hmm, let me see... Well, well, well.<br />
<br />
It seems that you do have the ability to become a monster hunter. But before that, I need to make it clear for you that becoming a monster hunter would not bring any money for you. We are not going to give you any gold! But you will gain more EXP after completing the quest published by our guild.<br />
<br />
We also united the Trade Union. You can gain more EXP after collecting supplies for Trade Union.<br />
<br />
However, to register as a monster hunter, you need to pay the registration fee. What? Why are you required to pay the fee? It is one of the ways to show your ability! The people without enough ability cannot become the monster hunter, and they can only become the meal of monsters.<br />
<br />
The registration fee is <font fg=FFA500>5,000 Gold</font>. Find me when you are well prepared.<br />
