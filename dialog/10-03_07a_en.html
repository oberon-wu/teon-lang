 (You took the <font fg=FFA500>Old Books</font> and turned the pages. The book mentioned some stories about legacies of King Arthur, but you were apparently not interested in spending too much time on reading. <br />
Somehow, a book with a more recent cover caught your attention. You found some documentaries regarding the <font fg=FFA500> Promise Island</font> and the name <font fg=FFA500>Rhoda</font> sounded very familiar to you.<br />
<br />
Time had washed away some of the transcripts, but you were curious to find out the missing episodes. <br />
<br />
Perhaps <font fg=FFA500>Rhoda</font> could tell you the rest of the story.)<br />
