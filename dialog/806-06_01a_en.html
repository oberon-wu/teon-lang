Now, we are all prepared! <br />
<br />
Recently, Maros Town is in equipment material shortage. We need to find a way to resupply our equipment materials. <br />
<br />
Our scout consider the <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope's Pelt</font> outside our town are best fit with one of material's requirement. I think we can acquire some for resupplement.<br />
<br />
Please help me to acquire <font fg=FFA500>20 </font>pair of <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope's Pelt</font>.<br />
