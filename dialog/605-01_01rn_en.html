Our Chamber of Commerce is delegating powerful adventurers with <font fg=FFA500>level 60 or above</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Mithril Block</font> for us in exchange for experience, Advanced Heroic Potion, and EXP Cube(120% EXP Buff).<br />
<br />
Since we have to avoid the behavior that excessively affects the normal market due to the materials collecting, before formally delegating you to collect Mithril Block, I need you to submit <font fg=FFA500>Rare Metal Collect Permit x1</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Rare Metal Collect Permit Vendor</font> and purchase the Permit.<br /><br />
