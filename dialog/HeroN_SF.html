Do you want an advanced <font fg=FFA500>Amulet of Heroism</font>? If you want to update it, you should collect enough <font fg=FFA500>Hero Emblem</font>, and put the amulet in your Bag before you update it. <br />
<br />
Amulet of Heroism will be unbind when it is <font fg=FFA500>Lv4</font>.</font><br />
Hero Emblem can be buy in the Mall. And the Advanced Hero Emblem can be acquire from Boss drop or future activities.<br />
