For the safety of the villagers, we need to get rid off both the <font fg=FFA500>Zombies</font> and the <font fg=FFA500>Deadly Lotus</font>.<br />
<br />
By the way, those <font fg=FFA500>Zombies</font> used to be, well you know, one of us. So, if you come across any <font fg=FFA500>Token of the Loved Ones</font>, bring <font fg=FF0000>10</font> of them to me.<br />
<br />
I would also want you to collect <font fg=FF0000>10</font> <font fg=FFA500>Spike Branch</font> for me. I could use some of those for herbal potions.<br />
<br />
Just a friendly reminder: you should use <font fg=FFFF00>Scroll of Polymorph</font>, so that they <font fg=FF0000>won't be hostile against you</font>.
