        Finally, you got a sword from Brooks [Weapon Shop], but you need to give it to Swain at Promise Island 2/F. Swain is in charge of watching over the entrance of Promise Island Dungeon 2/F and the Old Escape Tunnel, and his old sword has defeaten a lot of monsters in Promise Island Dungeon. As long as you take the old sword from Swain, you can give it to Taka [Warehouse] as his collection.<br /><br />
