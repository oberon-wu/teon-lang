I'm preparing the letter for you. During the time of waiting, could you please beat the <font fg=FFA500>King Attila's Spies</font>.<br />
<br />
Find the <font fg=FFFF00>Suspicious</font> <font fg=FFA500>Tramp</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Travelling Merchant</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Dartford Peasant</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Poor Peasant</font> and <font fg=FFA500>House Wife</font>.<br />
<br />
Then, turn on the <font fg=FFFF00>PK Mode</font>, defeat them and collect <font fg=FFA500>10</font> <font fg=FFA500>Spy's Report</font>. In this way, we can destroy the Attila's spying in Dartford, and guarantee the safety of Resistances and the organizations that support King Arthur's Descent.<br />
<br />
By the way, you need to be careful. If you attack the innocent citizens, a great amount of <font fg=FFA500>Karma</font> will be deducted. In case you may forget the way to define a spy, I will give you a piece of Intelligence Collection.<br />
