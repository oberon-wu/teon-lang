Anyhow, it's good to see you here. There are some <font fg=FFA500> Lesser Goblins</font> to my East.<br /><br />
I want you to defeat them, and bring back <font fg=FFA500>Goblin Dagger</font> <font fg=FF0000>x2</font> to me. <br />
<br />
Oh and here, take this <font fg=FFA500>Lesser Healing Potion</font> with you. It's not much but I just wanted to thank you ahead of time, or just for showing up.<br /><br />
<font fg=FFFF00>Long press an item/skill and drag it to your Hotkey Buttons. Click the Hotkey Buttons to [Use] skill/item immediately.</font><br />
