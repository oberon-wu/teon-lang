Do you want intelligence? You are in the right place. Our Hunter Guild is a good place to collect intelligences.<br />
<br />
What you want is not the normal intelligence and of course, it is not for free. I need you do me a favor. Do you know the <font fg=FFA500>Red Crystal</font> in <font fg=FFA500>Hunting Mountains</font>?<br />
<br />
I don't need those red crystals, but I need some <font fg=FFA500>Broken Red Crystal</font> that the Guild and other hunters would not collect. Please don't ask me the reason just like I won't ask you why you want these intelligences.<br />
<br />
Bring me <font fg=FFA500>50</font> <font fg=FFA500>Broken Red Crystal</font>, and I'll give you the intelligences.<br />
