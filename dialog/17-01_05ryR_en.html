Do you bring the materials? Great, please wait for a moment..................Done!<br />
<br />
You can keep this certificate I made and it shows my ability. In fact, I can build <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Armor (Imitation)</font> for you.<br />
<br />
But, I'm still doubting your identity. If you really want to build <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Armor(Imitation)</font>, except for some neccessary materials, you need to obtain <font fg=FFA500>Other Classes Certificate</font> to show that you have received the support of people of Edin.<br />
<br />
After you receive enough support, you can come here and ask me to build <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Armor(Imitation)</font> for you!<br />
