The guard standing beside the bridge is <font fg=FFA500>Sien</font>. Last time he ask me to dig some <font fg=FFA500>pearl</font> for him. He had to mill <font fg=FFA500>pearl powder</font> for the little elves in the Elven Garden. But I was too busy to dig pearls.<br />
<br />
I would like to trouble you and dig pearl instead for me.<br />
<br />
Here are <font fg=FFA500>Pearl Spade</font> x4, it can sense the location of pearls. You can dig <font fg=FFA500>pearls</font> at the <font fg=FFA500>showing location</font> with it.<br />
