There are more and more new adventurers coming here recently and it seems that they all come from a place out of Land of Edin. And some of them are beaten by some monsters.<br />
<br />
So, we want to collect more information about the monsters in some dangerous area so that we can reduce the risk for those new adventurers. But we are lacking manpower, so we are finding some qualified adventurers to help us out.<br />
<br />
If you can go to <font fg=FFA500>Maros Dungeon</font> 1/F and 2/F to collect <font fg=FFA500>20</font> <font fg=FFA500>Information of Deep Maros Dungeon Monsters</font>, then we can help those new adventurers.<br />
<br />
Go to Maros Dungeon 1/F and 2/F to beat those <font fg=FFA500>Evil Series</font> monsters and you can collect their inofrmation.<br />
