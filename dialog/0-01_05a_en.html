<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, some of the items you got back from the thieving monsters don't belong to me. I believe this box of armor belongs to <font fg=FFA500>Leah</font><a action='navigation?0:32784:32718'> [Armor Shop of Promise Island Town](32784,32718)</a>. Please bring this box to her. After you exit here, head <font fg=FF0000>Northeast</font> to find her!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:7|navigation?0:32784:32718"/></p>
