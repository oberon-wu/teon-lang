Hi, Darkelf, thanks for helping Edith!<br />
<br />
Are these the pearls <font fg=FFA500>Will</font> told you to bring? Thanks a lot.<br />
<br />
<font fg=FFA500>World Tree</font> starts to wither. We are all busy about it. As the influence, young elves become worse day by day. The pearl powder will increase their constitution. After I mill the pearls, please bring to <font fg=FFA500>Lia</font>.<br />
