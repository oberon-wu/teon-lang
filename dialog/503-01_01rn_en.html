I am in charge of delegating professional Monsters Hunters with <font fg=FFA500>Level 55 or above</font> to collect <font fg=FFA500>Information About Special Monsters</font> for us. Even on this Land of Edin where the monsters are rampage, these special monsters are way more horrible than normal monsters!<br />
<br />
To prove that you are qualified enough, I need you to submit a piece of <font fg=FFA500>Lv.3 Hunter Permit</font>.<br />
<br />
You can find <font fg=FFA500>Lv.3 Hunter Permit Vendor</font> to purchase the permit.<br />
