<font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font> is in the southeast of Land of Nature. From here to the southeast, pass through the Elven Garden and Orcish Region, then you can reach the Orc Town. It would be quite dangerous on your way to the Orc Town, be careful!<br />
<br />
You can also use <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Escape</font>. Use it in the Land of Nature and you will be teleported to the <font fg=FFA500>Orcish Guild</font>. Then, you can find the Teleporter and you are able to reach the Orc Town! Or you can also keep going to the southwest from the southwest gate of <font fg=FFA500>Orcish Guild</font>, and you can also reach the <font fg=FFA500>Orc Town</font> and find <font fg=FFA500>Lum</font>.<br />
