I'm afraid that it's hopeless to find these weapons back now. But you still needs a symbol, a certificate to make people recognize your ability to continue the past glorious reign of King Arthur.<br />
<br />
Except for you, I also have <font fg=FFA500>another guest</font>, a <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font>. He is deep inside of this cave.<br />
<br />
He is the sage, your guider who guide you to Edin's people. Go on, my dear, don't waste the time. Before being found out by Attila's men, talk to that <font fg=FFA500>Mysterious Mage</font> and leave as soon as possible.<br />
