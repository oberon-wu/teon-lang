This...This sword! Oh! You see, these scratches, there is some blood of monters on it.<br />
<br />
Did you say that you got it from a guardian who watched over the entrance of the Old Escape Tunnel? So does the tunnel that can connect the Land of Edin to the legendary Promise Island really exist? That is so mysterious and romantic!<br />
<br />
I won't ask you how did you get it, but I'll take this sword!<br />
<br />
As I promised you before, I did notice some suspicious <font fg=FFA500>Homeless</font>. Usually, every time when the Dartford Mushroom grown on the ground, those <font fg=FFA500>Homeless</font> would pick them up since they are all very poor. But some of the homeless <font fg=FFFF00>never pick up items, but wander around</font>. That's quite suspicious.<br />
