The Spectre Archer in Damelot Dungeon 2F is good at using their bows, which often bring us some trouble.<br />

We hope that you can defeat some of them while training inside the dungeon.<br /><br />



Head back to <font fg=FFA500>Damelot Dungeon 2F</font> to defeat <font fg=FFA500>Spectre Archer</font> and collect <font fg=FFA500>Heavy Rattan Bow</font>. <br />
