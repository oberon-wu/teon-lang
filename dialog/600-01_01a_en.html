Welcome, you are already an official monster hunter.<br />
<br />
By the way, we have united the Chamber of Commerce and I will introduce some powerful monster hunters to do some <font fg=FFA500>Voluntary Work</font> for Chamber of Commerce.<br />
<br />
Ah ha ha ha ha...<br />
<br />
Although it is voluntary work, you can still gain a lot of EXP from them. For the detailed information, you can ask <font fg=FFA500>President of Chamber of Commerce</font>. He is also in <font fg=FFA500>Dartford Castle</font>.<br />
