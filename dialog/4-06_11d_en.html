<font fg=FFFF00>Quest Description:</font><br />
        Without this Mana Energy Gem, Laucian's power will be greatly reduced and he will be unable to protect the periphery of Elven Garden and the Elven Dungeon. Please beat those Orc, Orc Fighters and Orc Zombie that wander outside the Elven Garden and the South-West or the South of Land of Nature. In this way, they cannot invade our Elven Garden within a short time.
