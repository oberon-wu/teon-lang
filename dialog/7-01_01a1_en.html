Recently I received report that there is unusual mana changes near the Glaurung Volcano. I think this is caused by the revive of the <font fg=FFA500>phoenix</font>.<br />
<br />
My friend <font fg=FFA500>Lamorak</font> is investing around the Dwarven Castle, near the Glaurung Volcano.<br />
<br />
But he has some trouble, I hope you can go to help him.<br />
