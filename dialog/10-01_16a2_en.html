At that time, that warrior came to <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island</font> bringing two young children with him. I saw him being able to stand on his ground and fight back when he was surrounded by those monsters. I don't know how, all of the men in this village suddenly gain the ability with the strength that have been brought by that warrior. <br />

Luckily, he still remember how to fight and still fond of the monsters characteristic.<br />
