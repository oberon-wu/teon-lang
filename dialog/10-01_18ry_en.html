Are you the novice who wants to report? It seems that you have put off a lot of time coming to me from <font fg=FFA500>The Timeless One</font>.<br /><br />

If you are lost while looking for a target person, you can tap the <font fg=FFFF00>compass icon on the top left of your screen</font> to open the <font fg=FFFF00>Map</font>.<br />
Inside the <font fg=FFFF00>Map</font>, you can activate the navigation arrow to find the specific location of NPC by pressing the <font fg=FFFF00>Direction</font> button which is located underneath the NPC name, and also you can <font fg=FFFF00>Bookmark a coordinate</font>.<br />
After you have bookmark your coordinate, use <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of teleportation (Blessed) </font> to be <font fg=FFFF00>teleport directly</font> to that location.
