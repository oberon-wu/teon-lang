<font fg=FFA500>Casey</font> tried to weaken our defence by raising the dead, causing fear and chaos among the villagers. Then he strengthened the force of the <font fg=FFA500>Orcs</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Goblins</font> by giving them the power of summoning.<br />
<br />
This time, he has brought in the <font fg=FFA500>Island Lycanthropes</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Island Werewolf Fighters</font>, the fierce and yet intelligent monsters. A group of them have taken the old forge shop <font fg=FFFF00> Northwest</font> from here.<br />
<br />
They are the most threatening monster we've ever faced here. I need you to go in and defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Island Lycanthropes</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Island Werewolf Fighters</font>.<br />
<br />
One of them should carry an <font fg=FFA500>Alchemist Stone</font>. It should be <font fg=FFA500>Casey's</font> source to control these intelligent monsters.<br />
<br />
Collect some <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope Fur</font> too while you take them down. They can be turned into good leather armor for the <font fg=FFA500> Defenders</font>.
