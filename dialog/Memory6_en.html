1.Role should be at least Lv 50.<br />
2.It can reset 「Base Points」 of role.<br />
3.Role will return to Lv 10 after reset and keep 「Additional」 point, and role can distribute again(「Additional」 means the additional points role get it after level up when it is at least Lv 50. The point can distribute by Role). <br />
