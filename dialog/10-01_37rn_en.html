The <font fg=FFA500>Invading Goblins</font> must be planning on something. We also sighted some <font fg=FFA500>Coastal Hobgoblins</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Coastal Hobgoblin Berserkers </font> on the beach south from here.<br />
<br />
Well, it's obvious that we need to do something about them. While you are at it, collect <font fg=FFA500>Hobgoblin's Herb Sack</font> x<font fg=FF0000>15</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Minion's Talisman</font> x<font fg=FF0000>5</font> for me.<br />

Again, these materials are for my reseach. *smiles*
