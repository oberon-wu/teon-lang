Hey, budy. Are you here to help me rebuild my pirate crew?

What? Do you have a map? Show it to me... Um, it is a treasure map. You can see that here is the remark of a location. <font fg=FFFF00>As long as you go the the location marked on this map, then you can start hunting the treasure.<font fg=FFFF00>

Bring this map back, and you don't need to pay this time.
