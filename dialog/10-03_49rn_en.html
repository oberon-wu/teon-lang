We need to defeat <font fg=FFA500>Expedition Friar</font>, but they unfolded the enchantment and hid the <font fg=FFA500>Alchemist Stone</font> inside the <font fg=FFA500>Island Lycanthrope</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Werewolf Fighter</font>. We could not launch a raid.<br />
<br />
You should go to defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Island Lycanthrope</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Werewolf Fighter</font>, reduce their amount and search for one <font fg=FFA500>Alchemist Stone</font>.<br />
<br />
By the way, collect <font fg=FFA500>Wolf Fur</font> x8, which are good leather when you cross the sea. <br />
