        Among the skeletons, there is one kind of them which have powerful attack which is the <font fg=FFA500>Elite Skeleton Axeman</font>. They carry powerful axes on their hands, which can easily collapse our magical barrier and interrupt our work. We need to avoid them before they start attacking, and grab their giant axes. Other Elite skeleton type monsters may also carry Skeleton Axe.
