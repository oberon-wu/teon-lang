I'm not sure whether you are qualified enough to know this, since this intelligence should not be known by the ordinary people.<br />
<br />
I have to test you so as to make sure that you are qualified enough. As the material of elemental enchant, elemental source crystal, is made of what materials apart from the <font fg=FFA500>Apocalyptic Source Crystal</font>?<br />
<br />
I don't need you to answer me. Bring that material to me.<br />

<font fg=FFFF00>Hint: Bring one <font fg=FFA500>Earth Ore</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Wind Ore</font>, <font fg=FFA500>Fire Ore</font> or <font fg=FFA500>Water Ore</font> to her.</font><br />
