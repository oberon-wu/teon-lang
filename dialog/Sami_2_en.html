The Resistance is decorating Maros Town. But some of our decoration was robbed by Atilla's army.<br />
<br />
We need adventurers to take them back. Some monsters may carry Wishing Star, defeat them and get our decoration back.<br />
<br />
I had received report that someone saw a strong monster carrying Shining Wishing Star!<br />
<br />
Some Maros resident may have their wishes. If you can help them, they might give you Shining Bell as rewards.<br />
<br />
When you collect enough Shining Bell, Wishing Star or Shining Wishing Star, you can give them to me. I will give you Dice for the Snow Fes Chess.<br />
