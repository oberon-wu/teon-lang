<font fg=636363>You took the old book and turn the pages. The book mentioned some story  about legacies of King Arthur, but it seems that you didn't read them carefully. <br />
In one of the book that looks newer, you read some story about <font fg=FFA500>Promise Island</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Rhoda</font>.<br /><br />

Some transcription have been damaged due to being stored in a harsh condition for a long time, the stories beneath them have been faded away with the time. You want to know what had happened on this island. <br /><br />

So, you decided to go and find this person called <font fg=FFA500>Rhoda</font>.</font><br />
