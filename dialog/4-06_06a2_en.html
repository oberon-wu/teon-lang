Long time ago, our elven garden lived with happiness and freedom. We didn't have trouble or fight with eachother and love eachother.<br />
<br />
But it didn't last long. Ugly <font fg=FFA500>Orcs</font> came to break our lives. They enjoyed war and fight. They occupied the forest of southeast and built the fortress.<br />
<br />
They usually robbed our resource and insulted our men. They invaded us for their desire!<br />
