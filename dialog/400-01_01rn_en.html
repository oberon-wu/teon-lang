Giggle... Adventurer, as you can see, I'm an Alchemist.<br />

Recently, there's something wrong with my research about alchemy. Um... It's a small problem but it brings a lot of troubles! That is... I cannot find the research direction! If you can bring me some golden items with magic or inherited some spirit, maybe I will be inspired by these. Don't worry, I just want to have a look, and I won't take your belongings. <font fg=FFFF00>(Bring Ring of Heroism x1 to the Alchemist)</font><br />
