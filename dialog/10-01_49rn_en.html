They are the most threatening monster we ever faced here. I need you to go in and defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthropes</font> and <font fg=FFA500>Werewolves</font>.<br />
<br />
One of them should carry an <font fg=FFA500>Alchemist Stone</font>. It should be <font fg=FFA500>Casey's</font> source to control these intelligent monsters.<br />
<br />
Collect some <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope Fur</font>, too while you take them down. They can be turned into good leather armor for the <font fg=FFA500>Defenders</font>.
