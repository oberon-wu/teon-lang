We need to banish those <font fg=FFA500>Friar</font>, but the <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope</font> nearby will attack us, that way we will also be caught.<br />
Defeat those <font fg=FFA500>Lycanthrope</font> first, to decrease their quantity.<br />
And don't forget to bring back some Lycanthrope Fur, they can be use as winter clothing for our army.
