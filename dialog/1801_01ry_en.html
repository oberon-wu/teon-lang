Thank you so much! You really bring these to me!<br />
<br />
Here is 12,000 Gold for purchasing the potions, please take it.<br />
<br />
Also, as I promised you before, let me to tell you something weird about those Merchants.<br />
<br />
Those <font fg=FFA500>Travelling Merchants</font> come here to purchase supplies from a very remote place. Normally, they are willing to spend money for some supplies from the adventurers.<br />
<br />
But some of them are very picky. It seems that they are buying supplies, but <font fg=FFFF00>whatever you give them, they will not buy</font> and not even sell things. That's what I found weird.<br />
