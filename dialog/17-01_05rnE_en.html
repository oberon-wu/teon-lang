So, you bring 4 <font fg=FFA500>Lump of Mithril</font> here? I will remake a <font fg=FFA500>Elven Class Certificate</font> for you, and you need to give this imitation to the king you follow. One day, when the king come here with this certificate, I will build the Holy Weapons you said for that person.<br />
