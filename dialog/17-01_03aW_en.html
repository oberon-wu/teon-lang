I think you've heard of the Holy Weapons owned by your father <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur</font> from <font fg=FFA500>Cassandra</font>.
<br />
It's such a pity that we cannot retake the Holy Sword and Armor back, but our future king really need them.<br />
<br />
I think, we can make <font fg=FFA500>King Arthur's Holy Weapons(Imitation)</font>.<br />
