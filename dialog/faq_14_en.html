2. Add items<br />
         Tap and hold an item then drag it into the trade window and you can set the trade item and item amount.<br />
3. Lock items<br />
         Once locked, the items in the trade window cannot be changed again. Now wait for the other party to lock their items.<br />
4. Confirm trade<br />
         When both parties have locked and checked the items in the trade window, they can complete the trade by taping on confirm button.<br />
5. Cancel a trade<br />

<font fg=FF0000>Important Notice</font><br />
Any trade completed in the game is <font fg=FF0000>irreversible</font>. We strongly recommend players to <font fg=FF0000>use extra cautions while trading with others to avoid unnecessary losses</font>.<br />
If the trade fails and your backpack is full, the overweighted items will drop to the ground.<br />
