<font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, some of the items you got back from the thieving monsters don't belong to me. I believe this box of armor belongs to <font fg=FFA500>Leah</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32784,32718)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[Armor Shop of Promise Island Town]</font>. Please bring this box to her. After you exit here, head <font fg=FF0000>Northeast</font> to find her!
