The monsters have been attacking us more frequently as of late, and I'm worried about our long-term survival. <font fg=FFA500><username /></font>, there is one warrior that I know. Unmatched on the battlefield, but he's been...let's say, out of touch with society for quite some time. His name is <font fg=FFA500>Rhoda</font> <font fg=FF0000>(32736,32743)</font> <font fg=FFA500>[House in Southern Promise Island Town]</font>, and he's been hiding in a house in <font fg=FF0000>Southern Promise Island Town</font>. Please find him and talk to him!<br /><br /><br /><p align=center><img src=#10497.4 action="quest?1:13"/></p>
