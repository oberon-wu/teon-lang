I can't give you the weapon back just yet, though. It hasn't been under good care, I'm afraid, so it's lost its battle power.<br />
Orc Fighters on Promise Island carry <font fg=FFA500>Shining Lumps of Iron</font>. They're the ideal material to repair this weapon. Use this Shining Trainee's Weapon to defeat Orc Fighters and collect 5 Shining Lumps of Iron. Bring them back together with the Trainee's Weapon when you're done.<br /><br />
