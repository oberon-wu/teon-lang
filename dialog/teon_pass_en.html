Greeting Adventurer! I'm Orianna, Teon Pass manager. I'm in charge many treasures' trading. But I'm only willing to barter for my goods. So show me your collection and we can have a great 'conversation'.<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to start your daily quest, you need to have both <font fg=FFA500>TP Basic Permit</font> and <font fg=FFA500>TP Daily Quest Permit (Quest)</font>.<br />
<br />
The <font fg=FFA500>TP Basic Permit</font> can acquire from first reward of Basic Teon Pass.<br />
The <font fg=FFA500>TP Daily Quest Permit (Quest)</font> can acquire from me.<br />
