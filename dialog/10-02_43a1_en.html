I have a <font fg=FFA500>Scroll of Enchant Weapon</font> for you, take and use it.<br />
You can ask other people to see if there are more scrolls that you can use for enhancement. <br />
By the way, <font fg=FFA500>Warren</font> seems to be looking for your. He is on the outside of the town to the <font fg=FFFF00>Northeast</font>.<br /><br />
<font fg=FFFF00>（Enchant your weapon to +4</font> and find <font fg=FFA500>Warren</font><font fg=FFFF00>.）</font><br />
