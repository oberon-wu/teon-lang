I still cannot accept your request. Only the king with more recognition is qualified to wear the Holy Weapons you said, even though those weapons are some copies.<br />
<br />
But I believe that you are not an ordinary advanturer. The person you support is definitely the king worth Edin people's following. <br />
<br />
I will keep your <font fg=FFA500>Elven Class Certification</font>, but the breath you have... makes me feel that your are quite different from the elves I met before.<br />
<br />
Maybe... You need <font fg=FFA500>that thing</font>. Take 5 <font fg=FFA500>Dark Magic Stone Lv2</font> and <font fg=FFA500>200,000 Gold</font> to me, and I will make a special item with the same powerful magic for you.
