The fact that the Just Man picked you to get his weapon back says a lot. That said, you'll still need to pass a little test of mine if you want the weapon!<br />
Here are 6 <font fg=FFA500>Weapon Enchantment Scrolls (Quest Exclusive)</font> and a <font fg=FFA500>Shining Trainee's Weapon</font>. You need to use the <font fg=FFA500>Weapon Enchantment Scrolls (Quest Exclusive)</font> to enhance the <font fg=FFA500>Shining Trainee's Weapon</font> 6 times.<br /><br />
